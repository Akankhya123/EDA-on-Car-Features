# EDA-on-Car-Features
The objective of this project is to do data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis
of the dataset and find out how different features of a car and its price are related.
The data comes from the Kaggle dataset "Car Features and MSRP". It describes almost 12,000 car
models, sold in the USA between 1990 and 2017, with the market price (new or used)
and some features.
